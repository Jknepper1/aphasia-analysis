I think my speech has gotten much better.
I feel my speech has struggled a lot as of late.
My speech has been really, really bad.
I don't feel like my ability to talk has improved all that much.
It seems like others can understand me a little bit better though.
I remember my stroke happening about five months ago.
I cannot remember when my stroke happend.
