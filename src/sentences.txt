The sun rose over the quiet hills.
She made tea and watched the rain.
I found a coin on the sidewalk.
Birds sing in the early morning light.
Let's walk to the park together now.
He forgot his keys at the office.
Books are stacked neatly on the table.
The cake smells delicious from the oven.
Dogs barked at the passing mail truck.
She painted her room a soft blue.
Water the plants every other day, please.
He plays piano every Sunday at noon.
The river flows gently past the trees.
Stars shine brightly in the clear sky.
