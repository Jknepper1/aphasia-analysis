I think my speech has gotten much better.
I feel my speech has struggled a lot as of late.
My speech has been really, really bad.
I don't feel like my ability to talk has improved all that much.
It seems like others can understand me a little bit better though.
I remember my stroke happening about five months ago.
I cannot remember when my stroke happend.
I remember suddenly not being able to see and then I passed out.
I woke up in a hospital on a bed and my wife was there beside me.
I had to drive myself to the hospital apparently, but I don't really remember that happening.
After my stroke, I felt generally pretty good.
There were frequent headaches and some odd numbness and tingling in my neck.
My wife took really good care of me.
She had to work hard, because I couldn't walk very well for a few weeks.
The walking was hard due to my feet being almost completely numb.
I couldn't talk good either.
No one could really understand anything I was trying to say to them.
This was really frustrating for me to deal with, and I like to talk a lot.
To recover, I had to have someone help me walk around every day for ten minutes.
I still can't talk very good, but I am here to work on that.
Potentially insert a story about some life event here.
There is a kid kicking a soccer ball into the sky.
The ball looks like it breaks the neighbors window.
The ball flys through the window and lands on the homeowner's lap.
The homeowner gets up and looks out the window to find out who did it.
Well, it looks like a kid doesn't want to take an umbrella from his mom.
Then, when he leaves the house it starts to rain really hard on the kid.
So he goes home to his mom all soaking wet and upset.
The mom probably teaches the kid a lesson about listening to his parents then gives him the umbrella.
The kid goes to school with his umbrella and a good lesson learned.
The first thing that happend was the cat running up the tree in order to get at the bird
Now the cat is stuck and the owner's daughter is trying to call the cat down from the tree
The owner even climbs the tree to get the cat but his ladder is knocked over by a mean dog.
So, the fire department is called to get the guy and the cat down from the tree safely.
There's obviously a girl in life-threatening danger here. 
A firefighter or police officer has jumped right into the flood in order to grab the girl.
It looks like it is possible that he ends up saving her, but we cannot tell from this photo if that is true or not.
Yeah, basically, cinderella has three really mean stepsisters who care a lot about their appearance.
Her stepmother doesn't support her at all and has forced her into servitude.
They are preparing for an important ball where thay may have the chance to court the prince.
Cinderella is considered ugly and lowly, but she uses some magic from a fairy godmother to be given a beautiful dress and shoes.
She has to run away at midnight from the ball when her magic runs out, but she loses her slipper.
The prince tries the slipper on ever maiden in the city, or something like that.
He eventually finds Cinderella this way and then chooses to marry her.
It is a good story about virtue, commitment, and kindness being the right things to do.
To make a peanut butter sandiwch is pretty easy.
All you have to do it get peanut butter, jelly, and bread.
Then you spread the peanut butter on one side and the jelly on the other.
You can use a knife to spread the sandwich, but there is nothing stopping you from using a spoon either.
Finally, you stick the sandwich together and eat it up.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are my absloute favorite lunch time food.
